## Overview

Pollify is a web application that allows users to participate in polls and view real-time poll results. It leverages **Appwrite** for backend services, managing databases, and handling authentication. The frontend is built using **React**, enhanced by modern tools such as React Router for navigation and **TypeScript** for type safety.

## Features
- **Poll Creation**: Admins can create polls with multiple options.
- **Voting System**: Users can select options and submit their votes.
- **Real-Time Results**: Poll results update live, showing the number of votes per option.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures unique voting.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Appwrite (for database and user management)
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel
